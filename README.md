## 🛡️ Overview
**MSF-repair_ToolKit** is a professional-grade framework designed to automate the installation, repair, and management of the Metasploit-Framework on Android (Termux).

* **📡 Instant Listener**: One-click setup for `multi/handler` to catch your shells immediately.
* **📦 Hangar (Secure Storage)**: Integrated management system to track and list all your generated payloads with file sizes.
* **⚡ Turbo Repair**: Fast patching for `Bundler 2.6.2` and Ruby dependencies.
